I modified this android project in Android Studio (2.2.3) on a MAC OS Sierra (10.12.1).

I added the ability to view a search item in a new page, a back button, and the ability to favorite search items. 

Besides the required functionality, I added the ability to un-favorite search items by clicked on their star icon again, the ability to scroll when a search item has a description that is too long, and a return to the original scroll position when hitting the back button. 

I have included screenshots from my Galaxy S7 (the device I ran the app on).
